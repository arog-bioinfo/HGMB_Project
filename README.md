# HGMBiome Project (Bioinformatics Project)

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the human gut microbiome—a complex and dynamic ecosystem—through the lens of genome-scale metabolic modeling. By integrating curated taxonomic profiles from GutFeelingKB with metabolic reconstructions from the BiGG Models database, we aim to simulate and analyze the metabolic behavior of microbes commonly associated with gut health.

Using tools such as SMETANA, MICOM, and SteadyCom, we simulate microbial community interactions to investigate:

    🧬 Metabolic cooperation and competition

    ⚖️ Community stability

    🔄 Resource exchange

We then apply dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to the resulting metabolic profiles to uncover microbial ecotypes and functional subnetworks characteristic of a healthy gut environment.

Ultimately, this project contributes to the functional stratification of the gut microbiome and supports the development of simulation-driven approaches to microbiome diagnostics and therapeutics.## 📌 Project Overview
