# Bioinformatics Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project investigates the human gut microbiome—a complex and dynamic ecosystem—through genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs). By integrating curated taxonomic profiles from GutFeelingKB (GFKB) with metabolic models from the BiGG Models database, we simulate and analyze microbial metabolic behaviors relevant to gut health.

Using tools such as SMETANA, MICOM, and SteadyCom, we simulate microbial community interactions to investigate:

    🧬 Metabolic cooperation and competition

    ⚖️ Community stability

    🔄 Resource exchange

We then apply dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to the resulting metabolic profiles to uncover microbial ecotypes and functional subnetworks characteristic of a healthy gut environment.

Ultimately, this project contributes to the functional stratification of the gut microbiome and supports the development of simulation-driven approaches to microbiome diagnostics and therapeutics.
