\section{Introduction}

The human gut microbiome plays a critical role in health and disease, influencing metabolic processes, immune function, and even neurological pathways. Advances in multi-omics analysis, particularly metagenomics and fluxomics, allow for a deeper understanding of microbiome composition and functionality. 

Recent studies have demonstrated that machine learning (ML) can be leveraged to analyze complex microbiome datasets, providing predictive insights into dysbiosis and associated health conditions. By integrating multiple layers of biological data, ML approaches can uncover hidden patterns and key biomarkers relevant to gut health.

In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that combines metagenomic and fluxomic data to classify gut microbiome states. Our approach aims to improve the identification of dysbiosis patterns, enhancing disease prediction and potential therapeutic interventions.
